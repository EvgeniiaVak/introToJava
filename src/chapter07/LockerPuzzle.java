/*********************************************************************************
 * (Game: locker puzzle) A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers   *
 * are closed on the first day of school. As the students enter, the first        *
 * student, denoted S1, opens every locker. Then the second student, S2,          *
 * begins with the second locker, denoted L2, and closes every other locker.      *
 * Student S3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker (closes *
 * it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed). Student S4 begins with      *
 * locker L4 and changes every fourth locker. Student S5 starts with L5 and       *
 * changes every fifth locker, and so on, until student S100 changes L100.        *
 *                                                                                *
 * After all the students have passed through the building and changed the        *
 * lockers, which lockers are open? Write a program to find your answer and       *
 * display all open locker numbers separated by exactly one space.                *
 * (Hint: Use an array of 100 Boolean elements, each of which indicates whether a *
 * locker is open (true) or closed (false). Initially, all lockers are closed.)   *
