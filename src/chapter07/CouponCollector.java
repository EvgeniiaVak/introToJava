/*********************************************************************************
 * (Simulation: coupon collector’s problem) Coupon collector is a classic         *
 * statistics problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick    *
 * objects from a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are       *
 * needed for all the objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the      *
 * problem is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find  *
 * out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked *
 * card is placed back in the deck before picking another. Write a program to     *
 * simulate the number of picks needed to get four cards from each suit and       *
 * display the four cards picked (it is possible acard may be picked twice).      *
